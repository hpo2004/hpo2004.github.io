            <p>Reading Response - <span style="font-weight:bold">As We May Think by Vannevar Bush</span><br>February 1, 2023<br></p>
            <div style="background-color: lightgray; height: 1px;"></div>
            <p> Comments: My main takeaways from this essay are 1) the author, Vannevar Bush, was very "ahead of his time" and 2)
            technology advances faster than we can comprehend therefore it is our duty to prepare ourselves for the future. 
            There have been other visionaries who predicted modern technology but I doubt many of them were able to conceive
            a device as accurate and with such detail as Bush and his memex. It is interesting to see how he adds 
            functionality to the technology, with "tapping keys" and "sets of buttons and levers". It shows that one can only
            predict within the scope of their current knowledge; had Bush written the essay during a time of "touchscreens" and
            "blockchain", his memex would likely have looked very different.</p>
