                <p>"Into Time with Mirrors" is an installation artwork created by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal in 2012.</p>
                <p>The artwork features mirrors, computers, and projectors arranged in a circular formation, creating a kaleidoscopic effect that reflects and distorts the viewer's image.</p>

            <div>
                <p>As the viewer moves through the installation, their image is multiplied and fragmented, creating a sense of disorientation and blurring the boundaries between the viewer's body and the surrounding environment.</p>
                <p>The artwork explores themes of time, identity, and perception, inviting the viewer to question their relationship with the world around them and the passage of time.</p>
