                   Comments: Harvey's opinions on digital art are very unique; it is refreshing to hear these unorthodox thoughts on
                   the art scene. I admire her willingness to break boundries to make her ideas tangible. However, I do believe that
                   it will take a very long time before this type of art is appreciated by "the masses" and acknowledged to the level
                   the general art we see in museums today. The timelines when making these comparisons are obviously very different,
                   but that does go to show how long it takes for avant-garde artists, like her, to be truly appreciated.
                   I am curious to know what steps Harvey thinks need to happen for digital sculptures to become a "household word" or 
                   merely rise in overall popularity and attractiveness.

                    Comments: My main takeaways from this essay are 1) the author, Vannevar Bush, was very "ahead of his time" and 2)
                    technology advances faster than we can comprehend therefore it is our duty to prepare ourselves for the future. 
                    There have been other visionaries who predicted modern technology but I doubt many of them were able to conceive
                    a device as accurate and with such detail as Bush and his memex. It is interesting to see how he adds 
                    functionality to the technology, with "tapping keys" and "sets of buttons and levers". It shows that one can only
                    predict within the scope of their current knowledge; had Bush written the essay during a time of "touchscreens" and
                    "blockchain", his memex would likely have looked very different.
