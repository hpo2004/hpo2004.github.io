                   Comments: Harvey's opinions on digital art are very unique; it is refreshing to hear these unorthodox thoughts on
                   the art scene. I admire her willingness to break boundries to make her ideas tangible. However, I do believe that
                   it will take a very long time before this type of art is appreciated by "the masses" and acknowledged to the level
                   the general art we see in museums today. The timelines when making these comparisons are obviously very different,
                   but that does go to show how long it takes for avant-garde artists, like her, to be truly appreciated.
                   I am curious to know what steps Harvey thinks need to happen for digital sculptures to become a "household word" or 
                   merely rise in overall popularity and attractiveness.
